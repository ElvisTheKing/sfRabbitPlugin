sfRabbitPlugin is symfony 1.4 plugin that provides access to rabbitmq messaging system.

Now it's just backport of videlalvaro's symfony2 [RabbitMqBundle](https://github.com/videlalvaro/RabbitMqBundle) and it uses unchanged videlalvaro's [Thumper](https://github.com/videlalvaro/Thumper) and tnc's [php-amqplib](http://github.com/tnc/php-amqplib) backend.
