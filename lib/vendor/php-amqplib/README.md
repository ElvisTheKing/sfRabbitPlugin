# NOTE #

This library is a fork of the [php-amqplib](http://code.google.com/p/php-amqplib/) library. 

We modified that library in order to work with PHP 5.3 Strict.

Also we improved the debug method to increase performance. 

We use it daily in prod for sending/consuming 600K + messages per day.

Below is the original README file content. Credits goes to the original authors.
